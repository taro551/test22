        Sergio Ramos Garc√≠a (born 30 March 1986) is a Spanish professional footballer who currently plays for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and the Spain national team. He most notably played as a centre-back for Real Madrid for 16 seasons, whom he captained. He also played as a right-back earlier in his career.

After emerging through Sevilla's youth academy and spending two seasons with the senior side, Ramos moved to Real Madrid in the summer of 2005. Since then, he went on to become a mainstay for Real Madrid, and had won 22 major honours, including five La Liga titles and four UEFA Champions League titles, becoming one of La Liga's top goalscorers from a defensive position. He played a crucial part in the build-up to all four UEFA Champions League wins, being named in the competition Squad of the Season each time. He also notably scored the equaliser in the 93rd minute of the 2014 UEFA Champions League Final. </p>
